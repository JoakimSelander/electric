# development
The development environment can be anything you like, however unit tests can only be run on a Raspberry PI 3 with 
a charger connected to it.

# coding, debugging - tools
Use PyCharm Pro.

There are a number of things to set up in order to obtain development nirvana.

1. a virtualenv for the development - see the README.md for more info on this
2. check out the source code (duh)
3. set up a PyCharm Remote Python Interpreter
4. set up PyCharm to automatically deploy changes to the PI3
5. rejoice - you can now edit/run/debug etc all from within the comfort of PyCharm while running code on an actual device
