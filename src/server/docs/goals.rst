What is the goal of this project?
=================================
The electric project aims to provide you with a way to control
almost all the features of the iCharger from your mobile device.  While the iCharger
user interface is perfectly adequate, we think its far cooler to sit
back in your deck chair at the field and glance at your phone or tablet to see
what the charger is doing. :-)

Using the provided app & server (see below for setup), you can:
 * start/stop the charger
 * make use of all your existing presets
 * easily modifying existing presets or create new ones
 * charger, discharge, store or balance your LiPo packs
