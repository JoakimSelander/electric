==========
Battery chargers are still potentially dangerous pieces of equipment if used without care.

While we've done our best to ensure the software works in the safest way possible, we
take no responsibility for any damage caused whatsoever whether caused directly or indirectly
by this software.

.. warning:: **seriously**, don't use anything other than the USB cable provided with the iCharger - there are known cases
 of the iCharger frying motherboards (in this case your Raspberry Pi 3).  You have been warned.

.. warning:: ** MORE SERIOUSLY **, the authors take no liability for any damages. Always be near your charger
when charging batteries.  We've made every attempt to create reliable and smart software, but
we accept no responsibility if it deletes all your settings, sets fire to your cat, and steals your cookies.
aka: Make a backup of your settings! (Charger Setup | Save & Load Config | Save to SD Card)
