Disclaimer
==========
While we've done our best to ensure the software works in the safest way possible, we
take no responsibility for any damage caused whatsoever whether caused directly or indirectly
by this software - even if it deletes all your settings, sets fire to your cat, and steals your cookies.

Before using this software we recommend making a backup of your settings. To do so use the iCharger UI to
go to the 'Charger Setup' menu, then 'Save & Load Config' and use the 'Save to SD Card' option.

Please do keep in mind - battery charging / chargers are still potentially dangerous - use them with care.

.. warning:: **seriously**, don't use anything other than the USB cable provided with the iCharger - there are known cases
 of the iCharger frying motherboards (in this case your Raspberry Pi 3) when non-iCharger included USB cables have been used.  You have been warned.

.. warning:: **MORE SERIOUSLY**, the authors take no liability for any damages. Always be near your charger
 when charging batteries.
