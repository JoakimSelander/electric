# electric
Battery charger integration, information and mobile app to view/control it all.

# what
This project provides everything you need to get information from your iCharger 308/4010 DUO to an application running on your desktop or mobile device.

## what - server
The back end is written entirely in Python, and exposes a RESTful API to the iCharger.

## what - frontend
The front end UI app is based on Ionic 2.

# how
To use this, you will need the following:

 1. iCharger 308, 408 or 4010 DUO
 1. The mini-USB cable provided with the charger (don't use anything else)
 1. A Raspberry PI 3 

Warning: 



# why
One day I was staring at my iCharger thinking: it'd be cool if I could get a notification when the charge cycle 
for my LiPo packs has completed.  

That was the start of this project.  

My brother and I fly RC model helis.  The hobby is complex, interesting, fun and has a fantastic community.  
We're involved in I.T. - and we figured we can use our skills to build something useful and give it back to everyone 
in the community and beyond.
