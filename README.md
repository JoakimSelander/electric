Battery charger integration, information and provisioning

# what
This project provides everything you need to get information from your iCharger 4010 DUO to an application running on your desktop or mobile device.

The idea is that you'll get a notification when the current charge cycle has completed.

# how
To use this, you will need the following:
1. iCharger 308, 408 or 4010 DUO
1. A mini-USB cable 
1. A Raspberry PI 3 

## how - my iCharger aka next steps
To make the channel status information of your iCharger available to the desktop and mobile apps, you will need to set up a Raspberry PI computer and plug it into the mini-USB port of the iCharger. 

# why
One day I was staring at my iCharger thinking: it'd be cool if I could get a notification
when the charge cycle for my LiPo packs has completed.  

That was the start of this project.  

My brother and I fly RC model helis.  The hobby is complex, interesting, fun and has a fantastic community.  
We're involved in IT - and we figured we can use our skills to build something useful and give it back to everyone in the community and beyond. 
 
At the least its an interesting project, at the most - who knows how far it'll grow.
