The Electric App
================

Currently we're using [Ionic View](https://view.ionic.io) to let people play with it while we develop it.
- Head over to https://view.ionic.io and grab the right app for your device.
- Create an account, and sign in
- Use the ID F944CAD8 to load up the app.

Caveats
-------
- Vibration & NOtification alerts don't work in Ionic View (they will when we release it properly)
- Ionic View is a little slower than native. Sometimes (I'm looking at you android) much slower.

Every now and then
==================
You'll want to keep it up to date. For now, just press 'sync to latest' when you run the app.


Here's how to configure it
==========================

Here's a [video of me configuring the app](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwXm_IYKCZY).
- Setting IP address
- Changing number of packs being show to 6 (I only have 6s packs)
- Enabling the vibrate and notification options
